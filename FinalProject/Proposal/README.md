## Proposal - Shradha Ganesh

### Project Title

Vox Designer 

### Project Summary 

An iOS app where the user can record their voice and add effects and modulation to it such as distortion, pitch shifting, reverb, delay and ring modulation

### Project Details 

The app will have a record button where the user can quickly record their voice (or any audio) and then have the ability to add different effects to it. There will be a button for distortion, pitch shifting, reverb, delay and ring modulation. This will be turned on if the user touches the button. Furthermore, the user will be able to adjust the amount of each effect. 

### What I can definitely accomplish for Final Project?

I can definitely accomplish having the recording and effects buttons implemented. 

### What I think I can accomplish for Final Project?

I think I can furthermore enable the user to be able to adjust the amount of each effect to the audio they recorded.

### What do I hope to accomplish for Final Project and as a final result?

As a final result (which I hope to accomplish), I would have everything implemented and furthermore have a way for the user to be able to bounce their audio and save it in their iOS device. 

### Research needed

I would need to research further on what/how things can be implemented using AudioKit. I would also need to  look at other ways to come up with good UI designs and interfaces.
