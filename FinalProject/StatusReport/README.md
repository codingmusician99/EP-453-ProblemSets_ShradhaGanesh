### What have I done so far for this project?

So far, I have implemented a Voice Recorder file that enables recording and saving of an audio file, started on the Recorder Controller file as well as the Voice Recorder view. 

### What have I not done so far for this project?

I have not yet implemented the effects that I wanted to add, i.e. Delay, Reverb, Distortion, Pitch Shifting and Ring Modulation. 

### What problems, if any, have I encountered?

I haven't encountered problems as such, however I need to check if I'm going in the right direction and also I need guidance in implementing the effects to the recorded audio file.
