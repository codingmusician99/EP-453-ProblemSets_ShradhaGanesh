### Vox Designer - An iOS app to record voice and add effects to design your own sound

### Created by: Shradha Ganesh

## What is Vox Designer?

Vox designer is an app for iOS, written in Swift, to enable the user to record their voice and simultaneously have added effects to their recording. In this app, the effects are Ring Modulator, Distortion, Pitch Shifter, Delay, Reverb and Flanger. 

## Details of the App

Vox Designer is an app for vocal processing. It's meant to be used as a sound design tool, except in this case instead of an oscillator, the user will use their voice as the oscillator. With the added effects in the app, it gives a totally new sound to the recorded audio which the user can use for a variety of instances. 

When launching the app, the app first asks the user permission to enable the usage of their device's microphone in order to use the app. This is in accordance to the privacy policy for iOS applications. Once the user enables the use of their microphone in this app, they are greeted by the Voice Recorder View with a greeting message. This is followed by the record button (the circle) with a message to prompt the user to use the button to record. 

Right below is a message to encourage the user to use headphones while recording, because the user will be able to hear the output of their recording with the effects while recording. Once the user has plugged in their headphones, they will be able to record their voice. Right above the record button is a message that prompts the user to tap it. This navigates to a new view where all the saved recordings of the user is stored. The user can now touch any of their saved recordings and they will be able to hear the playback of their recorded sound. 

The purpose of Vox Designer is to completely change the sonic element of the voice and give a new sound that the user can use for a variety of contexts. This is done with the use of the effects in the app. Once the user hears the playback of their recording, it will sound nothing like what they thought it would, but rather be a completely new sound produced from their voice/recording. 

## Developments to be made for the future

One of the shortcomings that this app has right now is the fact that the user can hear the speaker output while they are recording. While this may be preferred by some, most wouldn't and thus, beyond this class it will be the first thing that I'll work on improving. 

The second development that needs to be done is to enable the user to adjust the parameters of each of the effects so they chose the kind of sound they want. Right now, the app has a premade sound with premade parameters defined for each effect. While that does serve the purpose of completely changing the voice, it may be interesting to the user to have some control over that aspect.
