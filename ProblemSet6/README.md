### Description  

Problem Set 6.1 dealt with practicing using class where you had to determine a class that had variables pertaining to determining the weather and then you had to declare two instances of the class and determine the difference between the two by first assigning arbitrary numbers to each variable and then subtracting them from each other. Problem Set 6.2 dealt with making modifications to the TabPlayer app by adding a LoopView tab that looped two samples.
