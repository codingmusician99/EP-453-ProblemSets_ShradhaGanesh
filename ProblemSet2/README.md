### Description 

Problem Set 2.1 dealt with creating a playground in Xcode where we can practice the use of different data types in Swift and successfully printing them out. Problem Set 2.2 also dealt with creating a playground. In this case, it was to practice creating variables of different data types and also using compound operaters to string together a cohesive output. Problem Set 2.3 dealt with modifying the Oscillator project given in class by changing the waveform to sawtooth and also creating a new slider for amplitude.
