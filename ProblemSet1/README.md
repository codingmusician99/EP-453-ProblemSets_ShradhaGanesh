### Description

Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use Git version control system with GitHub and went over cloning the class repository and creating and pushing your own repository to submit problem sets for this class. Problem Set 1.2 was about Macdown formatting to format README.md documentation for the programs to be written in the problem sets. This had to be submitted with the HelloSwift program we did in class. For the HelloSwift Project, I further modified the text by making it bold and making it a Large Title instead of body text. 

### Dependencies (if applicable)

This program does not require any external libraries
