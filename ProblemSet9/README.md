### Description 

Problem Set 9.1 dealt with modifying and expanding the Audio Recorder project. We had to add a real time timer text to the project, fix the bug in the project where the recording would stop once the user touches the Recorded Sounds button and finally at a button in the library view that deletes all the recordings and refreshes the list view. 

### Dependencies

* AudioKit
* SwiftUI
* AVFoundation
