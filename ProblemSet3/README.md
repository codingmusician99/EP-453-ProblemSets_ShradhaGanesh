### Description 

Problem Set 3.1 dealt with creating a playground in Xcode to practice arrays in Swift, where we had to create an array with integer values and print out the elements properly. Problem Set 3.2 dealt with modifying the Synthesizer Xcode project from the class materials and modifying it. We had to add two additional sliders, one to control amplitude and another to control ramp duration of the amplitude.
