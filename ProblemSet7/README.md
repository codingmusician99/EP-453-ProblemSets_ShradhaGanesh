### Description

Problem Set 7.1 dealt with creating modifications and really expanding the MotionSynth App we created in class. You had to add a new view to the project where it would take a sensor data other than the attitudes to change the color, size or placement. You also had to create a flanger before the moog ladder in the motion synth and control the feedback and frequency using sensor data. You also had to add an on/off toggle which enables the user to switch on/off the synth by just tapping the screen. 

### Dependencies 

* AudioKit
